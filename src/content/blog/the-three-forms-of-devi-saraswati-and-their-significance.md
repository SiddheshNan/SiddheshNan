Devi Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge, wisdom, and arts, is one of the most revered deities in Hindu mythology. In Satyalok, the abode of Lord Bramha, she resides with her husband, Brahma Dev, in her three forms - Devi Vaani, Devi Gayatri, and Devi Savitri. Each form represents a different level of expression of speech and has its unique significance.

### Devi Vaani Swaroop

As the Vaam Angi of Brahma Dev, Devi Saraswati remains in her Adi Vidya - Devi Vaani Swaroop. In this form, she is fairer than uncountable moons, three-eyed, sitting on a white lotus, and dressed in a beautiful white saree. She is bejewelled in bright gold, diamond, pearl, and crystal jewelleries. In her four lotus-like hands, she holds Vedas, Aksha Mala, and a Veena. This is her Shabda-Brahm Swaroop.

### Devi Gayatri Swaroop

Devi Saraswati also resides in her Mantra Swaroop with Brahma Dev. The Mantra Swaroop of Devi Saraswati is called Devi Gayatri. In her Gayatri Swaroop, she is five-headed and wears a red saree. She is bejewelled with beautiful gold jewellery and sits on a bright red lotus. Sometimes, Devi Saraswati in her Devi Gayatri Swaroop is four-handed, and sometimes she is ten-handed. With the help of Devi Gayatri, mantras are developed within, which is essential in the creation process.

### Devi Savitri Swaroop

Devi Saraswati also resides in her Teja Swaroop with Brahma Dev. The Teja Swaroop of Devi Saraswati is called Devi Savitri. She sits on a pink lotus and wears a pink or orange saree. She is bejewelled with bright gold jewellery. Devi Saraswati in her Devi Savitri Saroop is four-handed, and in her lotus-like hands, she holds Vedas, Akshamala, Amrit Kalash, and a lotus. Devi Savitri also resides in the center of Surya Mandalam and provides tejas to Surya Dev as she is the Teja Swaroop of Devi Saraswati.

### The significance of the three forms

The three forms of Devi Saraswati - Devi Vaani, Devi Gayatri, and Devi Savitri - are the three levels of expression of a speech. With the tejas of Devi Savitri, the body gets energy, and with the help of Devi Gayatri, mantras are developed within. With the grace of Devi Vaani, the mantra comes out from the mouth as Vaak. It is believed that with the knowledge and wisdom of Devi Saraswati, Brahma Dev succeeds in the creation process.

The Devi Saraswati's three forms represent the power of knowledge, wisdom, and speech, which are essential in Hindu mythology. These forms remind us of the importance of education, learning, and the power of speech. We can seek blessings from Devi Saraswati to acquire knowledge, wisdom, and articulate our thoughts with clarity and precision.
