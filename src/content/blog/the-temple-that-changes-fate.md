This ancient temple with intense positive vibes is located 25 km from the Chennai-Tiruchirappalli highway in a village called Siruganur. From this village, you have to travel a further 5 km down to a tiny hamlet called "Thirupattur" where the ancient temple of Lord Brahma is located. It is widely believed that this is one temple that can change your destiny.


We all know that there are very few temples for Lord Brahma in the world. Lord Brahma is the creator of mankind. Even though there are no temples that are dedicated to Lord Brahma, the erudites who have read our religious scriptures claim that this is only a myth. There are no Shiva temples that do not have Lord Brahma's divine presence. He may not be there in the form of an idol. In all the Shiva temples, on the left side of Lord Shiva, Lord Brahma is present as a "goshtamurthy".

Let's delve into the historical narrative of the temple and then explore Sage Pathanjali's who is the author and compiler of Yoga's association with it.

### **The Story Behind the Temple:**

The Lord Brahma originally possessed five heads. This instigated Brahma to think that he alone possessed the power of creation and if he stopped doing creation, the whole world would come to a standstill. This led Brahma to consider himself the sole possessor of creation's power and was very proud of it. His belief in holding the fate of the world led to pride and arrogance.

The Lord Shiva, angered by Brahma's arrogance, cut off his fifth head and took away the power of creation from him. Realizing his mistake, Brahma immediately sought penance. With the help of others, he turned to Shiva, recognizing that only Shiva could save him. To atone for his sins, he came to Thirupattur and started praying to Lord Shiva after creating 12 different Shiva lingams.

During Brahma's penance, the goddess Ambal, known as Brahmasampathgowri, appealed to Shiva to pardon Brahma, citing his unintentional error. She assured Shiva that Brahma wouldn't repeat such arrogance. Shiva, agreeing to forgive Brahma, liberated him of his sin but chose not to restore his fifth head. This act was to serve as a lesson for future generations, emphasizing the consequence of arrogance.

Lord Shiva said, "O, Lord Brahma, I give you back your radiance and power of creation. I am pleased with your devotion. I have now changed your destiny. In a likewise manner, anyone who visits you in this temple, shall immensely benefit from your grace and shall find his destiny changed for the better."

While withholding the fifth head, Shiva reinstated Brahma's power of creation. He then requested Brahma to solemnly promise to bestow blessings ('Vidhi Irupin, vidhi kooti aruluga') upon all devotees who worshiped in the temple.

This temple holds significance in mitigating the consequences of 'Karma Vinai' also known as "prarabdha" which refers to the repercussions of deeds --- both good and bad --- done in past lives that define one's current fate. Devotees seeking solace in this temple find relief from their problems, as Brahma, empowered by Shiva, holds the ability to alleviate their suffering. Shiva instructed Brahma to reduce the severity of devotees' problems and alter their fate.

Hence, praying at this temple is believed to reverse the adversities in one's fate and redefine one's destiny. Mondays and Thursdays are auspicious days to visit this temple. This shrine also relieves you of all your doshas. It is even better if one visits the temple on the day of their Janma tithi or Janma nakshatra.

The popular belief is that as you light lamps in the temple, a similar brightness will engulf your life with the blessings of the Almighty. Make sure to light 36 light lamps (27 for nakshatras and 9 for nava-grahas) in the temple.

### **How to reach the Temple?**

If you're traveling by train, the nearest major train station is Tiruchirappalli (station code: TPJ). From there, you'll need to take a bus to reach Thirupattur. You'll find plenty of buses running along the Trichy - Perambalur highway, so it shouldn't be hard to find one.

From Tiruchirappalli (Trichy), a local brown bus numbered 98A will drop you right in front of the temple for a fare of Rs. 20. One bus leaves at 7:15 a.m. from the Chatiram Bus Stand (cluster servicing the Samayapuram route), taking about 90 minutes for the journey. Buses generally run approximately every hour.

If the timing doesn't suit you, head to the Perambalur cluster, situated next to the Samayapuram cluster. Buses to Perambalur are available every 15-20 minutes. Purchase a ticket for the Tirupattur stop (also known as Siruganur bus stop) along the highway for Rs. 25.

Upon reaching that stop, walk about 50 meters towards the Tirupattur stop (clear signages along the highway indicate the direction to the temple). Share taxis are usually waiting there, but they might wait to fill the seats. If you prefer to hire your own taxi, it's easier at Rs. 150 for an 8-passenger vehicle. If you have time to wait, it's only Rs. 20. The distance between the temple and the highway is 7 km(s).

For the return journey, buses are available about once every hour outside the temple, but there's no displayed timetable. Hence, it's simpler to hire or share a taxi to the highway and cross over to the Trichy side. There, you'll find a proper bus shelter with buses departing every few minutes for Trichy.

### **Let us walk into the Temple Precincts...**

The temple boasts of a magnificent "rajagopuram" that faces the east. As we enter the premises, the "kodi maram" welcomes us, following which Lord Nandi welcomes us. Lord Nandi is seated amidst a network of rudrakshas. This mandapam or hall is called as the Veda Mandapam.

As we walk further we come across the Nadha Mandapam. The pillars of this mandapam (hall) are symbolic of the seven swaras. Lord Brahma is considered to be extremely courteous, benevolent and kind. No one has ever returned empty-handed from this temple. As we cross the Nadha Mandapam, the dwarabalakas (or the guards) guide us into the sanctum sanctorum of Lord Brahma. This is the same Lord Brahma who himself was blessed by Lord Shiva.The mesmerizing feeling that you experience as stand before Lord Brahma with both your hands folded is to be experienced to be believed. The fragrance of turmeric invades your senses. Lord Brahma's idol is anointed with turmeric paste and he looks at you as if to say -- " I am there to help you, so why do you worry?". This idol is said to be a suyambu (something that came on its own).

The manifestation of Shiva is venerated here as Brahmapureeswarar because Lord Brahma's destiny got changed, along with his consort Brahmanayaki, also called Brahma-sampatha Gowri as the one who restored the glory of Brahma. Narasimhar is also present in the temple. The three main Hindu gods are present in this temple. One has to first worship Brahma for whom special pujas and prayers and performed. On Thursdays, he is specifically worshipped as Guru (Jupiter) and he is decked with turmeric paste.

They then worship Narasimhar(Vishnu) and then worship Lord Shiva and Ambal. The Bhairavar (a Shaivite deity) in this temple is very special. The Dwadasha lingams (12 Shiva Lingas) believed to have been worshipped by Brahma are present in the temple. And one can worship the twelve lingams in the temple.

### **An Interesting Bit...**

### **The Jeeva Samadhi of Sage Patanjali**

This temple complex houses the Jiva Samadhi of Patanjali Maharishi, the compiler of the yoga sutras. These texts laid the foundation of what we know today as yoga. Patanjali Maharishi is believed to have lived more than 2000 years ago.

He is believed to be the incarnation of Adi Sheshanaga who has a thousand heads. He was born to Athiri Maharishi and Anusuya Devi. He was reincarate to worship and rejoice in the splendor of Lord Shiva and witness his cosmic dance in the form of Nataraja.

Sage Pathanjali was the one who wrote about the art of yoga. And helped to write down & compile the Yoga Sashtra. He exhibited great wisdom to our nation and to mankind in general.

He is in fact mentioned in many ancient texts across India he is mentioned in tirumular's tirumandhiram a text that was composed more than two thousand years ago and also in the writings of the great Siddha Bogar. it was here that Sage Patanjali attained the Jiva Samadhi.

There is a beautiful story about him that Once he was teaching his students and had his thousand heads. There was a screen/curtain between him and his students which was put up to protect him from being seen by all. As he was Adi Sheshanaga reincarnate, the poisonous heat emanating from his body, and it was powerful enough to harm others while teaching. One of the students committed a mistake and what followed is history...

The **Jiva Samadhi** is an advanced state of samadhi; In which the sages attain union with the supreme absolute, willfully leaving the life force in the physical body. Since the life force is restrained within the body, the body does not die in the traditional sense, and so these sages are freed from the cycle of birth and death.

Though they have attained union with the supreme absolute, it is believed that their conscious energy would still be around to serve as a guiding light for seekers. And, it is said that in this way these realized beings can continue their work in teaching those who seek them out, and be a guide for humanity.

It is believed that Patanjali Maharishi attained this state via his yogic meditation and continues to work for the progression of humankind.The word yoga translates to union. The union with the supreme absolute where all differentiation ceases is the ultimate aim of any yogic practice.

Near the Brahmapurishwara temple is also another sacred spot where sage Patanjali along with another sage Vyagrapada witnessed the dance of shiva in the form of nataraja, where he expounded the art of yoga.

Whenever there is a Jiva Samadhi almost always there a Patala lingam nearby the Jiva Samadhi, and here in this temple you can see the Patala lingam right next to the Jiva Samadhi of Patanjali Maharishi.

Sitting beside the Jiva Samadhi of Patanjali and meditating is an experience in itself and will definitely bring about a huge betterment in our lives.

They also have the uncanny ability to manifest themselves by entering human bodies. This temple also has lakes (called as theerthams) like Brahma theertham, Bakula theertham (which is equivalent to Ganga in its sanctity). The water from the Brahma theertham is used to perform abhishekas on Lord Brahma.

Also, it is very good to buy Turmeric (Horn Turmeric / Finger Turmeric) according to one's Shakti when giving one's horoscope at the Brahma shrine. Ask the temple Iyer and buy it later.

The Panguni Uthiram festival is celebrated in a big way in this temple. Most festivals in Shiv temples are celebrated in the month of Panguni. The festivities start in Panguni and culminates in the Panguni Uthiram festival When the holy marriage is performed between Brahmmapureeswarar and Brahmasampathgowri.

Outside the temple, there are lines of shops that sell all religious items like lamps, oil, flowers, and incense sticks. There are also the famous "Nannari Sarbath" stalls that the South is famous for. "Nannari Sarbath" is a juice that is made from herbs to which a dash of lemon juice and water are added.

### **Hidden Symbolism Behind the Story and the Temple:**

Brahma is one of the qualified aspects of the supreme absolute, the infinite consciousness, and is entrusted with creating the material universe. On creating the universe his pride and ego as the creator gets the better of him.

He falls in love with his own creations and declares himself to be the greatest. He declares himself to be the supreme being, He is then chastised by Shiva who removes his fifth head, a representation of his ego.

As a result, Brahma also loses his power of creation. He realizes his mistake and sets out to make amends it is here in this sacred place that lord Brahma consecrated twelve Shiva lingams and venerated Shiva to free him from his ego.The lingam is a representation of the infinite both in manifest and unmanifest forms. shiva obliges and finally, Brahma is rid of his delusions and regains the power of creation.

The most important lesson of this temple is to transcend ego and finally understand the unity of all beings so that one can transcend the cycle of birth and death and move towards the state of sat-chit-ananda (pure existence, consciousness, bliss)

The aim of all the ancient dharmic sages was to transcend the cycle of birth and death and attain union with the supreme absolute. The adherence of the "bhakti-marga" the path of devotion and the "gyan-marga" the path of knowledge led their lives and practiced techniques to attain liberation "moksha", "mukti" once this life ends. According to the Siddha yoga marga the sages' approach to transcending the cycle of birth and death.

Since the fate of the creator himself was changed at the spot by Shiva many believe that this holy place is one where one's destiny could be rewritten by venerating Brahma and of course, one can only place righteous requests;

Like the Nandi fixed on shiva, the self should be fixed on the supreme absolute, in its journey towards becoming one with the supreme absolute.
